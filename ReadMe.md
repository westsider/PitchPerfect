Project Overview
===============
An iPhone app that allows users to record their voice and then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback.
Why this project?
===============
Pitch Perfect provides a substantial, while not overly complicated, introduction to the iOS ecosystem.What did I learn?
Create a new project
==================
Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device
Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
Why is this project meaningful to my career?
====================
MVC is the cornerstone of all iOS app development
